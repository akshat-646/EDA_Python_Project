**Diwali Sales Data Analysis**

A data analysis project to understand customer behavior and sales trends during the Diwali festival. The project focuses on cleaning, exploring, and visualizing sales data to extract meaningful insights.

**Introduction**

This project aims to analyze Diwali sales data to identify key trends and patterns. By leveraging Python's powerful data analysis and visualization libraries, we delve into various aspects such as gender-wise sales, age group contributions, state-wise performance, and popular product categories. The insights gained can help businesses make informed decisions to optimize their sales strategies.

**Features**

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, drops irrelevant columns, and converts data types to ensure data quality.

**Descriptive Statistics**: Provides summary statistics of numerical data and counts of categorical data.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
Analyzes sales based on demographics like gender, age group, marital status, state, and occupation.
Identifies top-selling product categories and individual products.

**Data Visualization**: Utilizes various plots (e.g., bar charts) to visually represent sales trends and insights.

**Technologies Used**

**Python**: The primary programming language for the analysis.
**Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
**NumPy**: For numerical operations.
**Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations
**Seaborn**: For creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
**Jupyter Notebook**: The interactive computing environment used for developing and presenting the analysis.

**Dataset**

The analysis is performed on the Diwali Sales Data.csv dataset, which includes information such as User_ID, Product_ID, Gender, Age Group, State, Occupation, Product_Category, Orders, and Amount.

**Project Structure**

**PYTHON_PROJECT_FINAL.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete data analysis workflow, from data loading to visualization.
**Diwali Sales Data.csv**: The raw dataset used for this project. (This file should be placed in the same directory as the notebook.)

**Usage**

Clone the repository (if applicable) or ensure you have both PYTHON_PROJECT_FINAL.ipynb and Diwali Sales Data.csv in the same directory.
Install the required libraries if you haven't already:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter

**Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

jupyter notebook "PYTHON_PROJECT_FINAL.ipynb
Run all cells in the notebook to execute the analysis and view the results.
